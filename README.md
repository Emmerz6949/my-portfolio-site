# My Portfolio Site

## Description

This repostory was created so I could test my ability to make a website using HTML and only Bootstrap for my CSS. It is a demo of a portfolio site,and not my actual portfolio site.



### How did I do it?

I used HTML to create the elements, and Bootsrap to style them. I also utilized the Bootstrap Grid Layout.

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/my-portfolio-site/index.html .



### Installation and Usage

There isn't anything to install or use as this is just a website that has been deployed.



### Credits

The styling was thanks to the power of Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).
